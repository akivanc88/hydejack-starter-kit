# How we do it

## Our Core Principles

{% include table.md %}

## You + Us

How do I start?  
{:.lead}

1. Create an account on our app

2. Follow our curated RHF-Athletes and their curated contents for a healthier lifestyle

3. Create personal milestones and set a financial target for yourself

4. Upload consistent proof of work/effort

5. Earn crowdsourced donations towards your milestone

6. Repeat

> Your complete presence on the web â€” A [blog], [portfolio], and [resume].
{:.lead}

## Proof of Effort + Community

Around **78%** of all new commitments to a health plan are dropped within the 1st 3 months.

> The primary reason: Lack of Motivation
{:.lead}

Interact with reputed athletes and create your own fanbase who will support you through your journey AND hold you accountable by following your live updates

## Feel Good + Earn

Becoming fit is a reward in itself, but why not earn some cash along the way too!!

For each milestone that you commit to, the more updates you provide, the more donations your fanbase will provide that you get once your milestone is complete
